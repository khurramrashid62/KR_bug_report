API Bugs

Tested with Postman ver 8.07

Bug #1

API â€“ GET employee

Invalid id returns 200OK

Send the following API
GET https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees/{id}
and use an invalid value for the id (i.e. one that does not exist in the table)

Expected Result >> API returns 404 not found
Actual Result >> API returns 200 OK with an empty result set

Bug #2
POST API will always default the salary value to 52000 even if a different value is specified in the body even though the PUT API will successfully modify the salary to a different value

Bug #3(possible)
POST API will allow entries with duplicate first and last name. 
Uniqueness of first+last names is not explicitly specified in the requirements but seems like a reasonable requirement. May not be a bug, but noting it down for review.

Bug #4
PUT API with invalid id (i.e. one that is not in the table) creates a new record with a salary of 0 instead of returning a 404 not found error

Bug #5
PUT API with missing id (i.e. not specified in the id) returns 500 internal error instead of 404 not found error

Bug #6
DELETE API returns 200 OK if a non-existent id is returned

Bug #7
PUT and DELETE APIs return 500 internal server error if the id is specified in incorrect format (e.g. incorrect number of characters) instead of returning 404 not found.

Other possible issues (non-funtional)
POST API should return 201 Created instead of 200 OK
DELETE API should return 204 instead of 200
